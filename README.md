# minimum-set-web-jpa
The minimum set of Java files needed to demo web and JPA with Spring Boot 2: A DAO or Enitity, A Repository (JpaRepository or CrudRepository), and a Controller (RestController). A DTO is optional (if it is the same as DAO, which is not a good idea in real life.)
You only need to code 3 Java files (Enitity, Repository, and Controller) to build a web application with a DB as backend. Enitity defines a DB table with fields. Repository could be an interface with 0 lines of code. Controller defines the web service endpoints, aka REST APIs.
Spring Boot 2 does its magic for you.
BTW, the app main and build.gradle are generated by https://start.spring.io/
